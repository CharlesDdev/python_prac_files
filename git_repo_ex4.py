#You now own some property and you want to calculate the total area of the property.

#Create a program that:

#Reads the width and height
#Prints the area
#Example: width = 5, height = 2
#Output: total_area = 10

width = int(input("Enter the width of your property:"))
height = int(input("Enter the height of your property:"))

total_area = width * height

print(f"total_area = {total_area}")
